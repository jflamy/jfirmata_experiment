## Full TCRR-compliant Refereeing Box with External Down Signal light and buzzer

This diagram is for a complete refereeing box that can trigger a down signal.

You can also use this diagram to create a separate device for the down signal by only using the left-hand part.

See https://wokwi.com/projects/354593337853679617 for the interactive diagram.

In the diagram, a blue LED represents the down signal light (relay triggered by pin A0) and the yellow LED represents the buzzer (relay triggered by pin A1)

Most commercial signal tower components exist in a 24V variant, such as [this offering](https://www.superbrightleds.com/single-color-led-light-module-for-signal-tower-stack-light#tab-all-accessories) where an individual white light module can be bought
