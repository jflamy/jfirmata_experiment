## Fully TCRR-compliant Jury Device

This diagram describes a full TCRR device with all the indicator LEDs.

It can be used when the jury prefers looking at the scoreboard instead of the owlcms Jury page. A laptop is still required on the jury table to provide power and act as go-between the device and owlcms.

The following wokwi project contains the interactive version of the diagram, that you can save as your own and modify. See the instructions in ../diagrams/README.md for editing and simulation.
