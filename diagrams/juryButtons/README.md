### Jury Buttons

This diagram describes a simple jury device with only the jury buttons.

It is meant to be used in conjunction with the Jury page in owlcms that shows the referee decisions and the jury member decisions.

The following wokwi project contains the interactive version of the diagram, that you can save as your own and modify. See the instructions in ../diagrams/README.md for editing and simulation.
