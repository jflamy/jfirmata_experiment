# owlcms-firmata
User-configurable device driver for [owlcms](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/index) refereeing devices built with Arduino (or similar) boards. This program relays commands from owlcms to the board and sends events from the board back to owlcms.  The program can handle fully IWF-compliant Timekeeper, Referee and Jury Devices (see the [diagrams](https://github.com/owlcms/owlcms-firmata/tree/main/diagrams) section for examples.)

![overview](docs/img/overview.png)

This program allows hobbyists to build their own devices and change pin assignments as required.  Any board that can be loaded with  [Firmata](https://github.com/firmata/protocol) can be used. Firmata (see the [firmware](https://github.com/owlcms/owlcms-firmata/tree/main/firmware) folder) is loaded once and not touched afterwards.

The pin configuration for a device is read from an Excel spreadsheet.  

- Each pin number can be mapped to a button and the MQTT message to be sent when the button is pressed is defined.
- Conversely, an MQTT message received can be mapped to one or more pins.  For each pin the expected action is given -- turning the pin on or off, flashing the pin, emitting a tone, triggering a relay. 

Furthermore:
- Schematics for building devices can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/owlcms/owlcms-firmata/tree/main/diagrams) folder in this repository. The pin allocations for these diagrams are built-in. The default pinout definition files are included in the Releases section.
- You can use your own pin allocations by taking the default files, editing them, and copying the files next to the program.
- Instructions for using the [Wokwi](https://docs.wokwi.com) Arduino simulator together with this program as also given: this allows running the design live with owlcms before building it.
- The program also supports the pin allocation for commercial devices being developed by the [Blue-Owl](https://github.com/scottgonzalez/blue-owl) project.
